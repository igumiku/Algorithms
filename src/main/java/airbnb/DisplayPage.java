/**
 * 4 Display Page (Pagination)
 * Given an array of CSV strings representing search results, output results sorted by a score initially.
 * A given host may have several listings that show up in these results.
 * Suppose we want to show 12 results per page, but we donâ€™t want the same host to dominate the results.
 * <p>
 * Write a function that will reorder the list so that a host shows up at most once on a page if possible, but otherwise preserves the ordering.
 * Your program should return the new array and print out the results in blocks representing the pages.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of csv strings, output results separated by a blank line.
